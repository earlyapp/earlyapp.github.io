# Motivation
Our aim for you the user: Empower you to achieve your goals on time, and help another do the same.

# How it works
- Schedule a check-in time with the Accountabot
- Indicate to the bot what you want to have compmleted by then
- The bot will attempt to pair you with a *real person* who has a check-in at the same time. 
- If it finds a match it will mediate a conversation with you and that other user, you will check if they met their goal, and they will check if you met your goal. 
- After the session closes in 5 minutes, the bot will ask you whether your partner completed their goal, and will ask your partner whether you completed your goal.
- Note that if the bot does not find a match it will still ask you if *you* made your goal.
